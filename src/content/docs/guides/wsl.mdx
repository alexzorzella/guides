WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. It installs a Linux distribution within your Windows machine so you can keep using Windows and experience the joys of a UNIX environment (with reduced performance)!

WSL is awesome. Install it by running the following in Powershell:
```ps1
wsl.exe --install
```

<Aside type="note">
    To install a specific distribution, use
    
    ```bash
    wsl.exe --install distribution
    ```
</Aside>

View your distributions with

```bash
wsl --list --verbose
```

Unregister a distribution using

```bash
wsl --unregister distribution
```

Update the current distribution with

```bash
wsl --update
```

Install C/C++ essentials with

```bash
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install g++
sudo apt install make
```

Install the WSL extension in VSCode for better IDE support.

Open code in VSCode using
