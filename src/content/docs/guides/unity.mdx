# Unity

## Your Unity License

Your Unity License is required to do some Git CI. To find your license, search your disc for a file called `Unity_lic.ulf`. If you can't find one, look for any `.ulf` files that might be it. Usually, license files are found in `C:\ProgramData\Unity`. If there is one, great! If not,

1. Open Unity Hub
2. Click 'Licenses' on the list of tabs on the left
3. Click '+ Add License'
4. Click 'Get a free personal license', even if you already have one. If you already have one, it won't override your old one.
5. Search for `Unity_lic.ulf` again

If you're on a computer with multiple users, you should delete your license file.

If you need the license for a secret for a Github Action, copy the entire contents of the file into the secret.
